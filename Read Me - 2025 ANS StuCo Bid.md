# This is a header
Hi! If you're reading this Markdown File, it's because you've reached the University of Michigan's Bid to host the 2025 American Nuclear Society Student Conference. I'm writing this as an initial file to host on the github so that I can get a feel for things, myself.

## This is a subheader - Why Markdown and LaTeX?
My name is Peter and I like working in markdown and LaTeX when possible. This document is in Markdown!

### Markdown?
Markdown is a very lightweight markup language that is easily parsed by both humans and computers. It's a plain-text editor, so there's minimal formatting without a dedicated app, but that's not incredibly necessary when it comes to some of the planning documents and readme files. 

### LaTeX?
LaTeX is a text editor that can be used to generate professional-looking documents with various types of formatting. Whereas Microsoft Word hides a lot of its formatting features behind an easy to understand user interface, LaTeX allows users to manually format their documents in a very explicit way. LaTeX is also excellent for mathematics and manging figures. You may have used LaTeX in your NERS 315 or NERS 515 courses before. There is an admittedly notable learning curve, but I promies you it gets easier to use LaTeX the more you use it! 

You can use LaTeX for free through [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). The nice thignhere is that rather than work in a single GIANT document, Overleaf can amass many smaller .tex files into a single large .tex file. this makes it easier to maintain source control / see what has changed from version to version. In fact, keeping things in github and Overleaf will allows us to keep very good track of what is changing and what is staying the same from edit to edit! this means that for your "part" of this bid, you only have to worry about your section, and once we put everthing together we can wory about getting formatting consistent.

## I've never used either, what do I do?
Just talk with me and I can give you a bit of a crashcourse in these two text-editors.
